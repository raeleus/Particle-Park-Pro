## Update

This project has been moved to a new repo under the libGDX organization. Please see here: https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-particle-editor
This repo will be archived for reference.

## Purpose

The purpose of Particle Park Pro is to replace the official libGDX Particle Editor. These are the goals of the project:

* Target all desktop platforms including M1 Macs.
* Disallow any use of Swing, AWT, or similar toolkits. Particle Park Pro is solely a Scene2D.UI project.
* Improve the workflow and interface for maximum efficiency and attractiveness.
* Export libGDX compatible particle effects. Extra features requiring a separate runtime library will not be supported.
* Include all features available in the Particle Editor.

## How to run

* Download the latest release from here: [releases](https://github.com/raeleus/Particle-Park-Pro/releases)
* Ensure you have at least JDK 11 installed on your system: [download](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/)
